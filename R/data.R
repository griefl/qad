#' A dataset containing 140 plots with estimated year of deglaciation and plant Shannon diversity.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 140 rows and 2 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{deglacYear}{estimated year of deglaciation}
#'   \item{div}{Shannon diversity of plant ecology}
#'
#' }
#' @details The data set contains the estimated year of deglaciation and plant diversity of 140 plots along the successional gradient of the forefield of the Ã–denwinkelkees glacier (Austria).
#' The plots (1 to 135) were established within the glacier forefield, the plots (136 to 140) were established outside the glacier forefield (i.e., age greater than 170 years).
#' Since qad is invariant w.r.t. transformations the estimated year of these 5 plots is set to 1800.
